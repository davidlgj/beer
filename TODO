Model
-----

Redis backend with a list.
One list to rule them all.

All of the data is cached in localstorage and synced when possible.
By just getting the last part of the list we can get the latest changes
this means we can never delete or update anything in the list.

Value is a json object which is either a whole object or a diff.
{
    "user": "david",
    "when": 12333443425,
    "name": "Bedar√∂ Bitter",
    "rating": 5,
    "comment": "240 characters of anger or bliss"
}

A diff is just a partial object, but 'user' and 'when' is key and should always be present.
There is a special diff to do deletes 'cause just deleting with empty object isn't explicit.

{
    "user": "david",
    "when": 12333443425,
    "delete": true
}

Users is also a list, but just an ordninary list with strings.
As you can see the backend model is made for syncing, and just a couple of users.
